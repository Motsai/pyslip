pyslip
======

A 'Serial Line Internet Protocol' (SLIP) implementation written
in python.

SLIP provides a simple encapsulation for reliably transporting packets
over stream oriented protocols (such as a serial line or TCP) by making
packet delimiting quite easy.

Currently, only  a SLIP decoder class is available.
